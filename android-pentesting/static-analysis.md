# Android Static Analysis

- Static analysis is a technique used to evaluate the security of an application by examining its source code without executing it.

### Types of Vulnerabilities that Static Analysis Can Detect

| Type              | Description                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insecure Storage               | Data stored in locations that other apps or users can access. |
| Hard-Coded Sensitive Information            | Sensitive information such as passwords and API keys embedded directly into the code.                |
| Insecure Communication             | Unencrypted or poorly encrypted communication that can be intercepted and read.             |
| Insufficient Cryptography               | The use of weak or deprecated encryption algorithms. |
| Insecure Permissions               | Requesting more permissions than necessary, giving the app access to sensitive data.                      |


### APK Downloading

- APK can be extracted from multiple resources.
    - Google Playstore
    - Manufecturer App Stores (Samsung Galaxy Store etc)
    - Third Party App Stores (APKPure etc)

### APK Extraction from Phone

- APK Export can be used to extract apk from phone
- We can also extract APK using adb.

```shell
# Find package name of your app
adb shell pm list packages | grep myapp

# Get path of the apk
adb shell pm path <package name>

# Pull the apk
adb pull /data/app/<package name>/base.apk .
```

## Disassembling the APK

- We can use APKTool to disassemble the APK.

```shell
apktool d <apk>
```
