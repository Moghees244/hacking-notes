# Active Directory Penetration Testing

## Introduction

Active Directory (AD) is a critical part of many organizations' IT infrastructure, serving as the backbone for user authentication, access control, and resource management. As such, AD environments are often targeted by attackers seeking to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or escalate their privileges within an organization.

Penetration testing (or ethical hacking) of Active Directory environments involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within the AD infrastructure to simulate real-world attack scenarios. This process helps organizations identify weaknesses in their defenses, allowing them to strengthen their security posture before malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to AD penetration testing, covering a range of techniques, tools, and best practices for assessing the security of an Active Directory environment. From enumeration and privilege escalation to attack vectors like Kerberos and pass-the-hash, this resource provides step-by-step instructions, detailed explanations, and practical examples to help you understand the various methods and tools used in AD penetration testing.

Whether you are a seasoned security professional or just starting your journey into AD security testing, this repository will provide valuable insights into how AD works, how it can be attacked, and how to better defend against these attacks.
