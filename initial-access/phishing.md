Mariusz Banach proposes a taxonomy for phishing payloads based on real-world observations of adversary behaviour.
He represents it as DELIVERY(CONTAINER(TRIGGER + PAYLOAD + DECOY)) where:

- Delivery is the technique used to deliver the package to the victim.
- Container is the container format used to package the files.
- Trigger is the means to trigger payload execution.
- Payload is the malicious code to execute.
- Decoy is a file to display to the victim.
