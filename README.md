# ðŸš€ Introduction

I am Moghees Ahmad. I'm working as Security Engineer at Tecvity. I have passion for Cybersecurity specifically in Red Teaming and Pentesting. As I embark on my journey, I'm actively pursuing cybersecurity education, I'm enrolled in courses and challenges on platforms like HackTheBox and Portswigger Academy.

## Current Activities

ðŸ“œ **Certifications:** I am currently studying for HackTheBox Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certification.

ðŸ”­ **CTFs:** Catch me in the virtual trenches of Capture The Flag challenges. Always up for a friendly competition and collaborative problem-solving. I have also uploaded walkthroughs of some CTFs and labs in a [repository](https://github.com/Moghees244/CTF)

ðŸ”§ **Experience:** I worked as Software Engineer in QA/DevOps Team at Siemens Digital Industries Software. During that period, I worked on developing CI/CD pipelines and test automation using Selenium.
