# ðŸ›œ WiFi Penetration Testing

Wifi Penetration tests have 4 components:

- **Evaluating Passphrases:** This involves assessing the strength and security of WiFi network passwords or passphrases.
Pentesters use dictionary attacks, brute force attacks, and password cracking tools, to evaluate this.

- **Evaluating Configuration:** Pentesters analyze the configuration settings of WiFi routers and access points to identify
potential security vulnerabilities. This includes scrutinizing encryption protocols, authentication methods, network 
segmentation, and other configuration parameters to ensure they adhere to best security practices.

- **Testing the Infrastructure:** This phase focuses on probing the robustness of the WiFi network infrastructure. Pentesters 
conduct assessments to find weaknesses in network architecture, device configurations, firmware versions, 
and implementation flaws that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the network.

- **Testing the Clients:** Pentesters evaluate the security posture of WiFi clients, such as laptops, smartphones, and IoT 
devices, that connect to the network. This involves testing for vulnerabilities in client software, operating systems, 
wireless drivers, and network stack implementations to identify potential entry points for attackers.
