# No SQL Injection

- There are four main types of NoSQL databases.
- The way NoSQL databases store data varies significantly across the different categories and implementations.


| Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                 | Examples                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Document-Oriented Database | Stores data in documents which contain pairs of fields and values. These documents are typically encoded in formats such as JSON or XML.    | MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB, Google Firebase – Cloud Firestore |
| Key-Value Database         | A data structure that stores data in key:value pairs, also known as a dictionary.                                                           | Redis, Amazon DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB                     |
| Wide-Column Store          | Used for storing enormous amounts of data in tables, rows, and columns like a relational database, but with the ability to handle ambiguous data types. | Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Azure Cosmos DB              |
| Graph Database             | Stores data in nodes and uses edges to define relationships.                                                                                 | Neo4j, Azure Cosmos DB, Virtuoso                             |
