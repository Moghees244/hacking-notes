# üï∏Ô∏è Web Penetration Testing

## Introduction

Web applications are an integral part of modern businesses, providing critical services and functionalities to users. However, they are also a prime target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt services.

Penetration testing (or ethical hacking) of web applications involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within the web application infrastructure to simulate real-world attack scenarios. This process helps organizations uncover security weaknesses, enabling them to strengthen their defenses before malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to web penetration testing, covering a range of techniques, tools, and best practices for assessing the security of web applications. From reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery to exploitation and post-exploitation techniques, this resource provides step-by-step instructions, detailed explanations, and practical examples to help you understand the various methods and tools used in web penetration testing.

### Key Topics Covered:

* **Reconnaissance**: Techniques for gathering information about the target web application.
* **Vulnerability Discovery**: Methods for identifying common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.
* **Exploitation**: Techniques for exploiting discovered vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.
* **Defensive Measures**: Best practices for securing web applications against common attack methods.
