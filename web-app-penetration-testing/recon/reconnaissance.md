This process involves systematically and meticulously collecting information about a target website or web application.
The primary goals of web reconnaissance include:

- Identifying Assets: Uncovering all publicly accessible components of the target, such as web pages, subdomains, IP addresses, and technologies used.
- Discovering Hidden Information: Locating sensitive information that might be inadvertently exposed, including backup files, configuration files, or internal documentation.
- Analysing the Attack Surface: Examining the target's attack surface to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This involves assessing the technologies used, configurations, and possible entry points for exploitation.
- Gathering Intelligence: Collecting information that can be leveraged for further exploitation or social engineering attacks. This includes identifying key personnel, email addresses, or patterns of behaviour that could be exploited.


# Types of Reconnaissance

- Passive Reconnaissance
- Active Reconnaissance

## Passive Reconnaissance

Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target without directly interacting with it.

- Search Engine Queries
- WHOIS Lookups
- DNS
- Web Archive Analysis
- Social Media Analysis
- Code Repositories

## Active Reconnaissance

In active reconnaissance, the attacker directly interacts with the target system to gather information.

- Port Scanning
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Network Mapping
- Banner Grabbing
- OS Fingerprinting
- Service Enumeration
- Web Spidering
